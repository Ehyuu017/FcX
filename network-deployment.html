                <h2>Network Deployment</h2>
                <p>With the continued growth in demand for dependable, high-speed and high-availability broadband services, 
                the importance of deploying fibre optic networks in a more innovative and efficient manner is more critical than ever.</p>
                <p>This growth places an increasing need for upgrading and modernizing legacy networks, where the importance of bringing 
                the optical fibre point-of-presence (FTTx) as close to the user as possible, 
                is critical for network performance and user experience.</p>
                <p>Building or expanding a fibre-optic network is very capital intense and requires careful planning and project execution. 
                Operators, Service Providers and other network owners are dependent on optimizing and finding innovative ways to lower operational 
                and capital expenditure while maintaining network quality, and ensuring a seamless and predictable user experience.</p>
                <p>With focus on quality and deployment speed, we are taking a holistic approach, starting in the early planning stages, 
                throughout the design phase, and into the deployment and commissioning. Our ambition is to maximize the versatility of the network, 
                minimize the environmental impact while at the same time reducing the cost and considerably improving the time to market 
                for new services.</p>
                <p>Our network deployment method is as efficient in a dense metropolitan area covering a few kilometres, 
                as it is in a suburban areas of tens of kilometres or in a remote rural area covering hundreds of kilometres.
                No matter who you are or what your organisations needs are, our goal is to make you look good.</p>
